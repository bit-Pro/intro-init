# intro-init
Instructions to be cloned into Task 1: intro-repo.

## What to do
You have ended up here because you followed a link given to you by the lecturer. This link made a repo for you to introduce yourself in, and also caused you to be added to the Vocational Skills for IT organisation on GitHub. Welcone!

You should clone this repo to your desktop and then add a text file (or use Markdown if you like) to introduce yourself to the class. Then commit your introduction and push it back to your remote repo here in the bit-Pro org for others to look at.

### What to include
You could include some of the following:
- Your name
- Your favourite hobby
- Your favourite aspect of IT
- Why you took VocSkills
- Anything else you want to share
